# API conventions

## HTTP contract

- Base path: `/api/v1`.
- JSON request and response models are typed with Pydantic.
- OpenAPI is the source for generated clients.
- Tenant context comes from the authenticated membership.
- Errors have a stable code, message, request ID, and optional safe field details.
- Collection endpoints define pagination, filters, and stable sort order.
- Updates use expected versions or ETags.
- Long work returns `202 Accepted` with an authorized job resource.

Consequential commands use explicit endpoints such as:

```text
POST /requisitions/{id}/submit
POST /awards/{id}/submit
POST /purchase-orders/{id}/issue
POST /analysis-runs/{id}/resume
```

Creates and consequential commands require an idempotency key. Reusing a key with a different
payload is a conflict.

## Health endpoints

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GET /health/live` | Process is running; no dependency check |
| `GET /health/ready` | Required database dependency is reachable |

## Events

Business state and an `outbox_events` row are committed in one transaction. Consumers assume
at-least-once delivery and deduplicate by event ID. The event envelope contains organization,
aggregate/version, event/schema type, actor, time, correlation, causation, and a minimal payload.

The first event families are `document.*`, `analysis.*`, followed by the procurement events listed
in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), Section 9.
